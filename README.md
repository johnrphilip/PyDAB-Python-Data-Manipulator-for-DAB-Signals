About
DABMaster is a Python application developed to efficiently manage and process datasets related to Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) signals. The application is capable of loading, transforming, cleaning, and statistically analyzing CSV data through a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It runs in a Jupyter Notebook and only requires two CSV files for its operation.

Features
GUI designed with Tkinter for intuitive data operations.
Data cleaning, transformation, and statistical analysis.
Optimized operations, including considerations for concurrency.
Comprehensive report accompanying the project.
Technical Highlights
Concurrency: To speed up data encoding and cleaning, the load_data() and clean_data() functions are designed for concurrent execution. Concurrency is a valuable feature for reducing processing time, particularly for large datasets.

GUI with Tkinter: Tkinter provides a simple yet robust framework for developing the GUI. It is rich in features, offering a seamless way to interact with the application.

Data Containers: Implemented efficient data structures like Pandas dataframes for data storage and manipulation, benefiting from Python's dynamic typing and flexibility.

JSON Handling: Utilized JSON for data storage to offer hierarchical data structures, easily handled by Pandas in Python.

Statistical Calculations: Used Pandas for statistical operations like mean, mode, and median, and SciPy for a chi-square test of independence, highlighting Python's strengths in statistical computing.

Data Visualization: Employed Seaborn API and Matplotlib for generating client-requested visualizations integrated into the Tkinter GUI.

What This Project Demonstrates
Advanced Python Programming: From concurrency to dynamic typing, this project is a demonstration of Python's capabilities in building robust data analysis tools.

Data Science Skills: Through data cleaning, transformation, and statistical analysis, I've showcased essential data science practices.

GUI Development: The use of Tkinter for GUI shows my understanding of user interface design, focusing on ease of use and real-time feedback.

Comparative Analysis: In the report, I've compared Python with Java in the context of data manipulation, diving deep into the advantages and disadvantages of each.

Statistical Analysis: Application of chi-square tests, and other statistical measures like mean, mode, and median to the dataset demonstrates my grasp of statistical methods.

Ethical Awareness: The accompanying report contains a section discussing the ethical implications of software engineering, revealing a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter beyond just coding.
